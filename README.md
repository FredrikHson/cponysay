# cponysay

a basic C implementation of [Ponysay](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay)

## Raising ponies

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FredrikHson/cponysay
cd cponysay
make
build/cponysay -h
build/cponysay 'I am a good pony!'
```

You can `make debug` if you suspect these ponies may have some nasty bugs.
